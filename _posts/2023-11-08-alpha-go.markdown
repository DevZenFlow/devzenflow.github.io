I have recently watched an award-winning documentary called [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y&t=5s). It follows a team of Google's DeepMind engineers who built a system to compete in an ancient game of Go. The documentary follows the DeepMind team as their AI model competes against, at the time, world Go champion - Lee Sedol.

Five games were played with AlphaGo coming out victorious in four out of five matches - a shocking and rather upset result for the huge Go community. 

The documentary left me with a range of emotions varying from amazement and excitement to sadness and anxiety. Moreover, it left me with three questions that kept bugging me:
- What is creativity?
- Is Alpha go creative?
- How do I feel about world's best player losing to an AI model and how might this impact my hobbies and line of work in the future?

In this post I am going to explore these questions in some depth. I understand that whatever answers I will come up with, will be highly subjective, but it doesn't mean I shouldn't seek these answers. Let's dive in.

##Â Why Go? 

Many of us have heard of a game called Chess, so let's start by comparing Chess to Go. A game of Chess has a smaller board and multiple distinct pieces with different mechanics and rules surrounding them. Go, on other hand, has a much larger board, only one distinct piece per sice playing but a significantly higher number of possible moves. 

|  | Chess | Go |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Board Size | 8x8 | 19x19 |
| Distinct pieces | 6 | 2 |
| Approximation of possible board positions | 10^50 | 10^170 |

Both games can be incredibly complex and the number of possible board positions can be unimaginable. Here's some numbers for comparison: 
- 10^13 is an approximate number of cells in a human body
- 10^27 is an approximate number of atoms in human body
- 10^69 is an approximate number of atoms in the Milky Way galaxy 
- 10^170 is a theoretical number so large that we cannot comprehend it

The key take-away here is that Go can be an incredibly complex game and in order to master it you need a human player or a computer system capable of churning through all this complexity. It is therefore a problem worth solving in the domain of AI.

## The Creative Move 37

AlphaGo made a move that media later named _Move 37_. I am not going to pretend that I understand the mechanics of the move, but what I do know is that media and Go community first saw it as a mistake and then, shortly after, realised it was creative. Lee Sedol himself said that it was 

> "really creative and beautiful." 

This takes us to my first question. What is creativity?
