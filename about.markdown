Hello there! My name is Viktor and this is my blog. This blog exists to share my learnings in a wide range of topics that interest me: 
- software and site reliability engineering
- productivity and effectiveness
- well being, health and longevity

I strongly believe that the best way to learn something is to teach others, so I created this blog with two goals in mind: 
- re-enforce my own understanding of various topics
- share my learnings and experience with others to help make world a slightly better place
